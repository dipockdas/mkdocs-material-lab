Grouping Components: Components of the same category or type are automatically grouped together in the default \"Inventory View\" for easier identification. Managing Views Creating and Saving Views: You can create custom views of your diagram by applying filters, moving components, and then saving these arrangements as views. Name your views for easy identification. You can rename the view at any time by clicking the ellipsis at the top of the Architecture State Diagram to access the View Actions panel and selecting \"Save\" or \u201cSave As\u201d. Switching Views: Access saved views from the main canvas navigation bar. Click the dropdown, located on the Architecture State Diagram menu bar, to access Catio-generated or your own views. Editing and Persisting Views: Any changes you make to the layout can be persisted in a view. A warning message will prompt you to save changes before navigating away. Resetting Layout: You can reset the layout to its original state or to the last saved state for a particular view by clicking the ellipsis at the top of the Architecture State Diagram to access the View Actions panel and selecting \"Reset View.\" Interacting with the Canvas Zooming: Use the pinch gesture on your trackpad or the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom in and out of the diagram. Scrolling: Use a two-finger drag on your trackpad or click and drag with your mouse to scroll around the canvas. Undoing and Redoing Actions: Use the \"Undo\" and \"Redo\" buttons in the toolbar to reverse or reapply your recent actions. Additional Tips Resizable and Collapsible Navigation Panels: Adjust the width of the left and right navigation panels by dragging their borders, or collapse them for more canvas space. Labeling for Icons: Icons are labeled with their service type and name for clarity. Hover over truncated names to see the full label. Multi-Select and Move: Use mouse actions to select multiple components and move them together on the canvas. Achieving Your Target Architecture View One of the key benefits of Stacks is the ability to edit and organize your architecture diagram to reflect your current or desired architecture accurately. This section will guide you on how to achieve your target architecture view.</p> <p>stacks architecture view Why Edit Your Architecture Diagram? Editing your architecture diagram in Stacks allows you to:</p> <p>Reflect Reality: Ensure that the diagram accurately represents your current architecture, making it easier to identify areas for improvement or optimization. Plan for the Future: Rearrange components to visualize potential changes or upgrades in your architecture, helping you plan and strategize more effectively. Customize Views: Tailor the diagram to your preferences, focusing on the components and connections that are most relevant to your needs. In the future, Stacks will offer auto-configuration features, providing you with pre-configured representations of common architecture setups. This will make it even easier to get started and achieve your desired architecture view.</p> <p>Where to Edit Your Architecture Diagram Stacks provides two default views for your architecture diagram:</p> <p>Full Architecture View: This view displays all components and connections in your architecture, providing a comprehensive overview. Inventory View: This view groups components by category (e.g. database) or type (e.g. relational, no-sql), making it easier to identify and focus on specific categories of components. You can work in either of these views to edit and organize your architecture diagram. Each view offers a different perspective, so choose the one that best suits your current task or goal.</p> <p>How to Achieve Your Desired Architecture View To achieve your desired architecture view in Stacks, you can:</p> <p>Move Components: Click and drag components to rearrange them on the canvas, creating a layout that reflects your desired architecture. Filter Components: Use the filter options in the left navigation panel to display only the components that are relevant to your current focus, helping you concentrate on specific areas of your architecture. Group Components: Utilize the Inventory View to automatically group components by category or type, making it easier to organize and visualize your architecture. By following these steps, you can effectively use Stacks to create a customized architecture diagram that accurately reflects your current or desired architecture.</p>"},{"location":"Stacks/3_search_filter/","title":"Search and Filter","text":"<p>Stacks supports search and filter features to help you quickly explore or edit the architecture diagram.
