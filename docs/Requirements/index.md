# Getting Started with Requirements
This guide will help you get started by guiding you through the process of uploading source materials or entering requirements directly using the chat interface. To efficiently generate requirements using Catio that will be used to create recommendations, follow these steps:

# Overall Process
Create a requirement. Begin by formulating a requirement. A requirement is a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound statement that outlines a need or desire for a product or service. Remember, a requirement is the core element that will guide the generation of recommendations. Thus, it is crucial to articulate at least one requirement before proceeding. The requirements may already exist in documents. Your requirements can be derived from various types of documents. These could include:

- Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- Functional Requirements Document (FRD)
- System Requirements Specification (SRS)
- User Stories
- Use Case Documents
- Product Specifications
- Bills of Material (BOM)
- Technical Specifications
- Project Plans
- Meeting Notes


Input your requirement into Catio. After formulating your requirement, the next step is to input it into Catio. This can be achieved via the user-friendly interface provided. 

Ensure you cross-check your input for any inaccuracies, as errors can affect the quality of the recommendations generated.

Review and edit your requirements. Once Catio has generated your requirements from the source material you provide, take the time to review the requirements for clarity and correctness. 

If edits are necessary, make the changes directly in the requirements screen or upload more information using the Edit with AI option. Remember, a clear and accurate requirement is crucial for generating precise recommendations.


## Uploading Source Material
To begin, navigate to the Input Chat Interface on the Requirements screen. Here, you'll see options for uploading documents or entering text for source requirements.

Click on the 'Upload' button to upload business, strategic, and product documents. Note that in this release, the application supports PDF document format only.

Once you've selected your document, click 'Submit'. The system will display a confirmation to acknowledge your submission.

You can upload more documents at any time to complete the requirements sections. The system will reprocess and update the requirements outputs with the new information.


## Entering Requirements using the Chat Interface
Alternatively, you can manually type requirements or edits directly into the system from the chat interface. This can be done on the document upload screen or the right-hand chat panel.

Type your requirements or edits in the text box located in the chat interface.

Once you've finished typing, hit 'Enter' to submit your text. The system will treat this manually inputted text with the same priority and integration as uploaded documents.

You can interact with the chat at any time, using typed text or uploading documents, and the application will generate requirements based on your input.


Remember, whether you're uploading documents or typing in requirements manually, all your submissions are public and persisted for all users across a workspace. The application will make all generated requirements visible to all users of the workspace. Any user edits will be visible to all users.
