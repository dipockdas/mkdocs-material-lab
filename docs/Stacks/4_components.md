# Working with components

Architecture State Diagram: This is your main canvas where you can view and interact with your components and their connections. The canvas is infinite, allowing you to work anywhere on the diagram without any constraints. This provides ample space for large and complex architecture diagrams, ensuring that you can freely arrange and visualize all your components and their relationships.

## Selecting Components

Click on a component in the main canvas or the left navigation panel to select it. You can select multiple components by holding down the "Ctrl" (Windows) or "Command" (Mac) key while clicking on each component. To select multiple components using point-and-drag action with the mouse, click the mouse cursor icon on the menu bar located at the top of the Architecture State Diagram. In all cases, clicking on a component will bring that component into focus on the main canvas.
Moving Components: Click and drag a component to move it around the canvas. You can also select and move multiple components simultaneously.

## Highlighting Components

When a component is selected from the filter list, search results, or directly on the diagram, it will be highlighted for better visibility.


Auto-Grouping Components

Components of the same category or type are automatically grouped together in the default "Inventory View" for easier identification.



Additional Tips
Resizable and Collapsible Navigation Panels: Adjust the width of the left and right navigation panels by dragging their borders, or collapse them for more canvas space.
Labeling for Icons: Icons are labeled with their service type and name for clarity. Hover over truncated names to see the full label.
Multi-Select and Move: Use mouse actions to select multiple components and move them together on the canvas.
