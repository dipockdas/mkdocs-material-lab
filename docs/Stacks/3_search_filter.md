# Search and Filter

Stacks supports search and filter features to help you quickly explore or edit the architecture diagram. Use the search and filter options in the left navigation panel to display only the components that match certain criteria, such as category or type. Use the display option in the filter panel to hide or unhide a component, category, or type. You can clear all filters by clicking the "Filters" menu option, located at the top of the Architecture State Diagram, and selecting "Clear Filters."

# Search

Left Navigation Panel: Access inventory items, filter components, and use the search functionality from this panel. You can resize or collapse it as needed.
Architecture State Diagram: This is your main canvas where you can view and interact with your components and their connections. The canvas is infinite, allowing you to work anywhere on the diagram without any constraints. This provides ample space for large and complex architecture diagrams, ensuring that you can freely arrange and visualize all your components and their relationships.
Right Detail Panel: View details of selected components from this panel. You can resize or collapse it as needed.
