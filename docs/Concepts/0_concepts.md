## Integrations

Connections or configurations that allow a workspace to interact with external systems or platforms (e.g., cloud services, databases). Integrations are now managed at the workspace level, supporting multi-environment visibility.


## Architecture Model

## Workspace

The highest-level container within a tenant, supporting organizational hierarchies. Workspaces contain multiple environments, integrations, and users with explicit access. It allows for organizational and project-based management. 
Workspaces :

- belong to Simple or multi-layer org hierarchies (business unit/department/project).
- Have Integration management at the workspace level.
- Contain Environments, architecture models, requirements and recommendations.
