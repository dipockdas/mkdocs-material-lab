# Overview

An integration is essential to populate the architecture state model, which is the backbone of your Stacks user interface. Without at least one integration, you won't be able to visualize your architecture state. So, let's get started!

The steps to set up an integration are as follows:
1. Access Catio. Navigate to your Catio dashboard. If you don't have an account yet, sign up and log in.

2. Create a new Integration. Click on the "New Integration" button. This will open a form where you need to provide details about the integration.

3. Fill in the necessary details. You'll need to provide details like the name of the integration, the type of data source, and any necessary configuration details.

4. Save and test. After filling in the details, save the integration. It's a good idea to test the integration to make sure it's working as expected.

5. Monitor the Integration. Once the integration is running, it will start populating your architecture state model. Monitor the integration to ensure it's working correctly.


A few potential issues you could face during this process include:

- Incorrect configuration. If the integration isn't working, double-check your configuration details. A small typo can prevent the integration from functioning correctly.
- Data source issues. If your data source isn't set up correctly or isn't accessible, the integration won't work. Make sure the data source is correctly set up and accessible.
